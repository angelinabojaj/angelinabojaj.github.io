            <h2> Internship </h2>
            <p> The biggest focus of my life right now is my love for my internship. For the past 6 months, I've been working as a marketing & hospatality
            intern for Grizzly Catholic Campus Ministry. It's truly transformed my life and has been an amazing experience. Surprisingly I've
            been able to apply my computer science skills a lot in my position as I manage social media networks and do digital designing. At the moment
            I've been brainstorming an app for our students to use that keeps them posted on our ministry events.

            <h2> Chacutterie Boards / Cooking </h2>
            <p> Over the past year I've grown in love for cooking! One of my favorite forms of cooking has been demonstrated in chacutterie boards.
                Whenever I have free time and spare cheese, meats, and fruits around, you can find me in the kitchen trying to design new layouts. It's a great
                hands on activity that gives me downtime from electronics.

            <h2> Reading </h2>
            <p> Reading is one of my favorite hobbies to do! I love reading my Bible or other poetry and theology based books. Created For Greater Things Mother Teresa's Life & Writings with a Commentary by Gloria Hutchinson, 
                The Raw Stillness of Heaven by Tim Bete, and The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri are some of my favorites.

            <h2> Traveling </h2>
            <p> I love traveling! I've been to various states and most recently traveled to Colombus, Ohio for a conference called SEEK. There
                was 16,000 students from across the east coast and south coming together to develop in the Catholic-Christian Faith. I truly
                miss being there as I had the chance to meet lots of new people and gain lots of experiences such as recording peoples hot takes.
