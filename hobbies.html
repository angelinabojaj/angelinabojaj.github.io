        <h2> Internship </h2>
        <p> The biggest focus of my life right now is my love for my internship. For the past 6 months, I've been working as a marketing & hospatality
            intern for Grizzly Catholic Campus Ministry. It's truly transformed my life and has been an amazing experience. Surprisingly I've
            been able to apply my computer science skills a lot in my position as I manage social media networks and do digital designing. At the moment
            I've been brainstorming an app for our students to use that keeps them posted on our ministry events.

        <h2> Chacutterie Boards / Cooking </h2>
        <p> Over the past year I've grown in love for cooking! One of my favorite forms of cooking has been demonstrated in chacutterie boards.
            Whenever I have free time and spare cheese, meats, and fruits around, you can find me in the kitchen trying to design new layouts. It's a great
            hands on activity that gives me downtime from electronics.
