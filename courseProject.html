        <h2>Ethical Data Mining of GoodReads: The Piano Lesson By August Wilson - CSI 5810 </h2>
        <p> Github Link: <a href="https://github.com/angelinabojaj/GoodReads-ThePianoLesson-CSI5810" target="_blank">GoodReads-ThePianoLesson-CSI5810</a><br>
            Description:For my final project in CSI 5810, I created a program that ethically data mined reviews for the book "The Piano Lesson" by
            August Wilson. I was the sole developer of this project as such, all components were developed by me. The aim was to observe
            common phrases and reviews left by users along with predicting future reviews for the book as well. Diagrams and charts using
            NumPy and various other Regression models were used. <br>

            Description: For our final class project, we were tasked with creating a program to execute SQL queries. I developed a method
            to search what animals were in certain enclosures through front-end and back-end code. At the same time I created, designed, 
            and managed the database by hand.<br>

            Description: As group leader I was responsible for the development, continous improvement, and overall completion of the project.
            As part of Sophmore Project (CSI 2999), we were required to make a project from scratch. Thus, as a group we were
            inspired to develop a program that provided better accessibility to the Kresge Library. I spent countless nights 
            debugging and coding this project as it was the first time I ever used databases for my programs. This project, which I learned
            a majority of my current database knownledge from, set my understanding for future projects and courses. <br>
